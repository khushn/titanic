### Titanic problem of Kaggle

This is the intro problem over there. But good to try out some learning. 

Also thanks to Coursera for reusing a lot of code, which was as part of their deeplearning.ai course. I did rewrite some functions as they were not available. Namely Relu/Sigmoid and their backwards/derivatives.
